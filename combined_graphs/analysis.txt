Accross all graphs there seems to be a lot of people on a U. Much more then would be expected

PP graphs:
    On the bar graphs there seems to be a slit from PP and no PP students. With those that are PP seeming to be achiving worst grades.
    With the histograms the non PP students seem to be a fairly flat histogram, suggesting their grades have something else behind it. The PP and SEN students both have a right skewed to the data, suggesting they have lower grades

SEN graphs:
    On the bar graphs they follow the same trend as the PP pupals
    With the histograms the year 10 data both seem to be slightly right skewed, though this stops for the non SEN students and start to shift to no distribution


Line graph:
    both year 11 and year 10 mocks seem to corrolate well to the final grade achieved. However the year 11 mock seems to have a large spike at 5-5 - 6-5. This could be due to a lower amount around the lowest grades. This could mean more students trying later on, making it a better predictor.
