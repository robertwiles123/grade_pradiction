The SEN graphs show a clear right skewed data for non SEN students with the histographs for both the X and y variables. Due to this being a nature of the data it does not seem appropriate to undersample the data for non SEN students. 
For SEN students they do seem to not have this right skew and for it to be lower over all.
This shows that SEN is definetly something to consider for machine learning

There are no PP students and therefore this is dropped from analysis.
